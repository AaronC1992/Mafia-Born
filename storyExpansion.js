      title: "Making a Name",
      text: "The streets are starting to know your face. When you walk into a bar, conversations pause. When you pass a corner, dealers nod. You're not a nobody anymore — you're becoming somebody. And in this city, being somebody is the most dangerous thing you can be."

      title: "The Point of No Return",
      text: "You look in the mirror and barely recognize yourself. The person who started this journey — scared, hungry, desperate — is gone. In their place stands someone hardened by choices that can't be unmade. There's no going back. The only direction is up."

    15: {
      title: "Empire Builder",
      text: "Your operation runs like a machine now. Cash flows in from a dozen sources. Your crew handles problems before they reach your desk. Somewhere between the first heist and today, you stopped being a criminal and became an institution."
    },
    20: {
      title: "King of a Concrete Jungle",
      text: "They write about you in the papers now — without using your name, of course. 'An unnamed crime figure.' They know. Everyone knows. The question isn't whether you're running things; it's how long you can keep running them."

    25: {
      title: "Living Legend",
      text: "Young kids on the corner tell stories about you the way they used to tell stories about Gotti and Capone. You've become a myth. And myths, for better or worse, have a way of outliving the men who inspired them."

      title: "Beyond the Crown",
      text: "You've surpassed every marker of success this life has to offer. More money than you can spend. More power than you need. The only challenge left is the one you've been avoiding: what happens when you stop?"

  // Deep narrations for first time events
  firstTimeEvents: {
    firstKill: "You'll remember this night forever. Not because of what you did — but because of how easy it was. The weight you expected to feel... it never came. That absence is more terrifying than the act itself.",
    firstArrest: "The cell door closes with a sound you'll hear in your nightmares. Eight feet by ten feet. A cot, a toilet, and time. So much time. You understand now why some men break in here.",
    firstBigScore: "You count the money three times because the number doesn't seem real. More cash than your parents earned in five years, spread across a kitchen table in a safehouse that smells like cigarettes and ambition.",
    firstBetrayal: "The hardest part isn't the betrayal itself — it's realizing you should have seen it coming. Trust is a currency in this world, and you just went bankrupt.",
    firstGangRecruit: "Your first recruit looks at you with a mixture of fear and hope. You recognize that look — you wore it yourself, not so long ago. You're responsible for this person now. Their future is your burden.",
    firstPropertyPurchase: "You sign the deed with a name that's mostly yours. The building isn't much — but it's yours. A foothold in the legitimate world. A brick in the wall between who you are and who you pretend to be.",
    firstTurfClaim: "Yours. This corner, this block, this neighborhood — it answers to you now. Stand here long enough and you'll feel the pulse of the city beneath your feet. It beats in time with your ambition."

  // Atmospheric world-building narrations (shown during regular gameplay)
  worldTexts: [
    "The neon sign of Sal's Pizzeria flickers in the rain. Inside, two men in expensive suits eat calzones and discuss the price of loyalty.",
    "A black sedan rolls slowly down Arthur Avenue. The driver doesn't stop, doesn't look. But everyone on the street knows they've just been counted.",
    "The old men play bocce in the park like they have for fifty years. They pretend not to see the drug deal happening on the other side of the fence. In this neighborhood, blindness is a survival skill.",
    "Graffiti on the overpass: 'SNITCHES END UP IN DITCHES.' Someone has crossed it out and written below: 'GRAMMAR MATTERS — IT'S DITCHES.'",
    "The produce stand on Mulberry Street has the best tomatoes in the city. It also has a back room where men settle disputes with their fists. The tomatoes cost extra if you need an alibi.",
    "Church bells ring at St. Anthony's. Inside, a priest hears confessions that would make a prosecutor weep. The seal of confession has protected more criminals than any lawyer.",
    "Rain falls on the East River, turning the water the color of dirty money. Somewhere beneath the surface, there are things that will never be found. The river keeps its secrets.",
    "A stray cat watches from a fire escape as men load unmarked boxes into a van at 3 AM. The cat has seen this before. It will see it again. The city's real witnesses have four legs and no subpoena power.",
    "The barbershop closes at 6 PM. The real business starts at 7. By midnight, more money has changed hands over haircuts and hot towels than the stock exchange processes in a day.",
    "Dawn breaks over the Brooklyn Bridge. Commuters stream toward Manhattan, oblivious to the empire being run from the apartments above them. Empires hide in plain sight.",
    "An ice cream truck plays its melody down a residential street. Children run with quarters in their fists. The truck also takes twenties, from adults who aren't buying ice cream.",
    "The subway rumbles beneath the city like a heartbeat. In the tunnels, there are places that don't appear on any map — meeting points, dead drops, and last resorts.",
    "A grandmother hangs laundry on a fire escape in Little Italy. She's done this for sixty years. She's also the best lookout on the block. Nothing happens on her street without her knowing.",
    "Thunder rolls across the skyline. In penthouse offices high above the city, men make decisions that trickle down to corner boys who will never know their names.",
    "The bodega on the corner sells cigarettes, lottery tickets, and alibis. The owner has never seen anything, heard anything, or been anywhere. He's the most knowledgeable blind man in the borough.",
    "Pigeons scatter from a rooftop as two figures meet in silhouette. Whatever they're discussing, the pigeons won't tell. They're the only reliable partners in this city."
